1. **Define the web extension architecture**
   - Document how the PHP web app communicates with backend API routes.
   - Identify reusable backend endpoints (alerts, summaries, users).
   - Define URL/environment configuration for local and deployed usage.

2. **Create web-app project structure**
   - Keep the existing Expo mobile app under `frontend/mobile/` and build the dedicated PHP web app under `frontend/web/` with organized subdirectories for views, components, services, and assets.
   - Organize views, reusable PHP components, API client helpers, and assets.
   - Add `.env.example` (or config template) for API base URL and environment settings.

3. **Implement backend connectivity from PHP**
   - Create PHP service wrappers for existing backend endpoints (alerts, summaries, user data).
   - Handle authentication (if needed) and include necessary headers.
   - Implement robust HTTP error handling (timeouts, non-2xx, malformed responses).
   - Normalize response objects for use by presentation templates.

4. **Design and implement unique web UI screens**
   - Build a web homepage/dashboard distinct from the mobile experience.
   - Add core feature pages for alerts, summaries, and user profile/preferences.

### Step 2: Smart Alert Prioritization System

#### Tasks:
1. **Define ranking criteria**
   - Risk score
   - Distance from user
   - Severity
   - User sensitivity

2. **Implement prioritization algorithm**
   - Compute a normalized priority value per alert.
   - Resolve ties deterministically (time/severity/freshness).
   - Support configurable thresholds for high/medium/low urgency.

3. **Integrate prioritization into alert pipeline**
   - Apply ranking before alerts are returned to clients.
   - Include priority metadata in API responses.
   - Preserve raw alert context for auditability.

4. **Surface prioritized results in UI**
   - Show ordered alerts in both web and mobile experiences.
   - Add priority labels and concise explanation text.
   - Ensure fallback behavior if scoring data is unavailable.

### Verification Checklist:
- Risk scores are computed consistently for same inputs.
- Prioritized alerts reflect the defined ranking factors.
- API contracts for score and priority fields are documented and tested.

**Deliverables**:
- Risk scoring engine implementation
- Prioritization algorithm integrated into alert flow
- Updated API endpoints/schemas
- Test coverage for scoring and ranking behavior
- Documentation of model logic and tradeoffs

### Progress So Far
